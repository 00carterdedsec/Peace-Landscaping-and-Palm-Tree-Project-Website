# Peace-Landscaping-and-Palm-Tree-Project-Website


"Act as an expert UI/UX designer and front-end developer. I need you to create the complete HTML, CSS, and (if necessary) JavaScript for a premium, single-page website for my business, 'Peace Landscaping and Palm Trees'.
The design must be modern, elegant, and professional, similar to the provided design inspirations. The overall feeling should be tranquil, luxurious, and trustworthy.
Key Requirements:
1. Layout: A single-page, responsive design with a sticky navigation bar that smoothly scrolls to each section.
2. Color Palette: Use an earthy and peaceful color palette:
• Primary: Deep forest green and olive green.
• Secondary: Sandy beige or warm off-white for backgrounds.
• Accent: A muted gold or terracotta for buttons and highlights.
• Text: Dark charcoal (almost black) for body text and white for text on dark backgrounds.
3. Typography: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (like Montserrat or Lato) for body text and a slightly more elegant serif font (like Playfair Display) for main headings.
Please build the following sections in this order:
1. Navigation Bar:
• A simple, sticky-top navbar.
• Logo on the left: "Peace Landscaping" (you can just use text for now).
• Links on the right: Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact.
2. Hero Section:
• A full-screen, high-quality background image of a beautiful, manicured garden that prominently features palm trees.
• A semi-transparent dark overlay on the image to make the text pop.

• Sub-headline: "Expert Landscape Design and Palm Tree Specialists"
• Button: A primary accent-colored button that says "Get a Free Consultation".

• A brief paragraph describing the company's philosophy of creating peaceful, beautiful outdoor spaces with a special focus on sustainable practices and the art of palm tree placement.
4. Services Section:
• Title: "Our Services"
• Use a 3-column card layout. Each card should have a relevant icon (like a palm tree, a shovel, a water drop), a service title, and a short description.

• Card 2: Title: "Palm Tree Specialists", Description: "Expert installation, trimming, and health management for all varieties of palm trees."

5. Gallery Section:

6. Contact Section:
